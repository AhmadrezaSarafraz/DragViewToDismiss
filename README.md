# Read Carefully

You can use this helper in 2 separate ways !


# 1-DragViewToDismiss

It's a modal view that you can drag it down to dismiss it.

# Usage

Just download the demo project and copy paste the codes to your project.
I create this for test and practice so the codes are not perfect but they work.


# 2-ExpandableTopView

This one is much cooler.

![](preview2.gif)

You can create a simple view with any height you want in top of your controller and put anything you want in there.
thats it!

# Usage

Just copy 'DragMeDownView.swift' to your project & subclass your top view from it.

You can adjust some details about it in storyboard as well.
